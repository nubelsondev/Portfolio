This is my first **UI / UX Design** course project with **Figma**, a **money management** application that allows us to make transfers, monitor spending and more.
I think every Frontend Developer **must and needs** to learn Design because it makes the development process faster and **more productive**. "**Since you already have the hammer very sharp, now you just need to cut the tree!**".
I am taking advantage of the knowledge I am archiving to remake the look of both Web and Mobile from all my previous projects.
