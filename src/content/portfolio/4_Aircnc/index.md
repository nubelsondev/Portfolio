This is the clone of **Airbnb**, a simple web application made with **React.js** which allows us to **create spots** so that non-employed developers can spend a few hours **programming** in a developer environment within the company that published the spot. I also built a **Mobile Version** with **React Native**, [check](https://github.com/nubelsondev/Aircnc-Mobile).
