This is **Neardev**, the idea of ​​creating this app came from the difficulty I have, not only finding manpower, but also **finding other developers** near me that I can **exchange an idea** about the **technologies I'm studying**, sometimes I have a developer studying the same technology as me on my street and I don't even know this person exists.
This is my favorite application (for now), it has two interfaces (Web and [Mobile](https://github.com/nubelsondev/Neardev-Mobile)) in which the Web is only for **registering** and **listing** users and **Mobile** is the real application, it has an **integrated map** that accesses the current **location** and shows all developers using the same technology as you within a **10 kilometer radius**.
