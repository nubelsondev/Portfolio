Hello! I'm <span>Nubelson</span> , a _self-taught_ 22-year old <span>Full-Stack Developer</span>, born in _Angola_ and currently living in <span>Portugal</span> who loves to <span>design and build</span> things for <span>Web</span> and <span>Mobile</span> devices. I build websites and applications with _exceptional performance_ and interface with <span>efficient and modern backends</span>.

I have _been programming with JavaScript_ since <span>2016</span> and since then I have _learned_ and been _involved with the best technologies_ that surround it, thus creating memorable and interesting products that in addition to providing users with a pleasant Interface and Experience, were also written with <span>scalable</span> code, thus allowing developers to be able to _understand and maintain_ easily.

Apart from <span>books</span> and <span>tutorials</span>, in the last year I took several <span>online courses</span> like [The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/), [The Complete React Developer Course (w / Hooks and Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-2nd-edition/), [Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/), [The Great Gatsby Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM) ,[Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/)...

I am <span>motivated</span> by _the challenges I encounter daily_ and motivated even more by the satisfaction of knowing that, with _focus_, _determination_ and <span>coffee</span>, I can _always overcome them_.
